# We're going to come up with a way of mapping strings to numbers in a range \[[from...to]\]
# We'll just do it by hashing the strings and taking the first L decimal digits, then scaling and shifting to get the result in the right range.

# COLLISIONS
# We'll assume the results of sha2 is uniformly distributed based on the input, then the first L decimal digits are also.

# In that case, the chance of collision can be
